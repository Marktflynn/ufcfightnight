# Project ufcfightnight

A package that uses Twitter API and creates a scatter plot using ggplot

## Description

This code will allow you to pull information from the key term "ufcfightnight" from Twitter. This will show how people on the platform 
are engaging with the event and what commom themes are being discussed. I will be incorporating the ggplot package 
that will create visual data that will show a certain topic being compared to other time periods. I believe you can 
only go back and dig up data from a max point of 6-7 days before. 

### How to use

Make sure you are logged into a Twitter account and connect to the API 

https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api

#### What to expect/how to interpret

The code will produce a scatter plot that compares favorites versus retweets linked with the keyword "ufcfightnight".
It will show results pulled from 100 tweets.
